#CS:GO Competitive Matchmaker

Use this program to pick which competitive servers you want to play (all gamemodes).
Since all servers are blocked via firewall rules there is 0 chance of being banned by VAC Anti-Cheat.

#---

#Usage:

#Blocking

Click block on every server that you do not want to play on, click again to unblock them.

#Unblocking

1: Press "Unblock" next to a blocked server, alternatively, reset blocked servers by clicking the "reset" button at the bottom of the program.
2: Closing the program will reset all firewall rules set to block servers.

#Limitations:-

Unfortunately, this program needs to be run using administrator priviledges as it executes a cmd prompt to execute firewall commands.
You may also need to increase your maximum acceptable ping ingame via the developer console.

#This program no longer works

Unfortunately, this program hasn't worked since Valve introduced "Steam Datagram Relay" to connect players to game servers.
